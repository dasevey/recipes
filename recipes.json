Best Baked Tofu delish.com Servings: 2 - 3 serving(s) Ingredients 1 (14-oz.) block extra-firm tofu, drained 2 cloves garlic, grated 1\" piece ginger, grated 2 tbsp. low-sodium soy sauce 1 tbsp. Sriracha 3 tbsp. toasted sesame oil, divided 2 tsp. rice wine vinegar 2 tbsp. packed brown sugar 1 1/2 tbsp. cornstarch 1/4 tsp. baking powder 1 green onion, thinly sliced, for garnish Toasted sesame seeds, for garnish Steps 1.  Carefully pat tofu dry: On a cutting board, sandwich tofu between doubled layers of paper towels and press down slowly to remove moisture without cracking the block. Remove paper towels and cut tofu into 32 equal pieces: halve tofu laterally across, then cut the block into a 4x4 grid. 2.  Make marinade: In a medium bowl, whisk together garlic, ginger, soy sauce, Sriracha, 2 tablespoons sesame oil, vinegar, and sugar until smooth. Set aside half this mixture and reserve for glazing later. 3.  Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Meanwhile, add tofu to bowl and toss gently to coat in marinade. Let sit 15 minutes, then drain off excess marinade. 4.  In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and baking powder. Sprinkle over tofu and gently toss to coat evenly. Drizzle over remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil and toss to coat each piece. 5.  Spread tofu evenly out onto a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, decrease oven temperature to 375\u00b0. Flip tofu pieces to allow for even toasting, then return tray to oven and continue to bake until tofu is crispy on the outside and deeply golden, about 15 minutes more. 6.  Brush with reserved marinade mixture for a glaze finish, then sprinkle with green onions and sesame."

      "Softening the cashews first helps them blend. If you have a high-powered blender you may be able to skip this step, but if not, this step is important to get a smooth cheese. You can either boil or soak the cashews. To boil the cashews (the fast method): add the cashews to a small pot, cover with water, and boil for about 10 minutes until the cashews are very tender. To soak the cashews: add the cashews to a bowl, and cover with water. Let soak for 4 hours or overnight until tender. Drain and rinse cashews before using.",
      "To make the vegan mozzarella:",
      "Add the cashews along with the 1 cup of water and all the remaining ingredients to a blender. Blend until completely smooth. It will be very watery.",
      "Pour into a small saucepan and put over medium-high heat. Continually stir. The cheese will start forming clumps, keep stirring and it will continue clumping until the mixture turns from watery to a thicker melty cheese sauce. This takes about 5 minutes. Serve hot or allow to cool and store in an air-tight container in the fridge for 2 - 3 days. The cheese will get thicker as it cools but will stay in a melty state."

Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat icing ingredients together on high speed for 1.5 \u2013 2 minutes. When lifting the whisk up off the icing, the icing should drizzle down and smooth out within 5-10 seconds. If it\u2019s too thick, beat in more water 1 Tablespoon at a time. I usually need 10 Tablespoons but on particularly dry days, I use up to 12-14 Tablespoons. Keep in mind that the longer you beat the royal icing, the thicker it becomes. If your royal icing is too thin, just keep beating it to introduce more air OR you can add more sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar.",
      "When applied to cookies or confections in a thin layer, icing completely dries in about 2 hours at room temperature. If icing consistency is too thin and runny, it will take longer to dry. If the icing is applied very thick on cookies, it will also take longer to dry. If you\u2019re layering royal icing onto cookies for specific designs and need it to set quickly, place cookies in the refrigerator to help speed it up. See blog post above for make-ahead and freezing instructions."

      "Soak the corn husks",
      "Place the corn husks in a large bowl and cover them completely with very warm water and place something heavy on top of them to keep them submerged.  Soak for about 30 minutes until softened.",
      "Mix the masa dough",
      "Meanwhile, in the bowl of a large stand mixer, add 6 cups of masa, 1 tablespoon cumin, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon baking powder, and 1 teaspoon garlic powder then mix until combined.",
      "Add the 3/4 cup of melted refined coconut oil, then beat on low speed until combined.",
      "Then slowly add the vegan broth, and beat on low speed until combined.  Once all of the broth has been added, increase speed to medium, and beat for 8 minutes until fluffy. Stop occasionally and scrape the sides of the bowl if needed.",
      "Add 1 cup of New Mexico red chile sauce to the batter and beat again for 2 more minutes until it's well incorporated. (You can refrigerate your dough at this point if you are not ready to assemble the tamales.)",
      "Prepare your fillings",
      "Carne - Saute 1/2 an onion and 2 cloves of crushed garlic in 2 tablespoons of cooking oil until the onion is translucent. Then sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon cumin, 1/2 teaspoon oregano, and add 2 cups of vegan beef crumbles (sub jackfruit, pinto beans, vegan chicken, vegan ham, or vegan steak). Cook until the vegan meat is heated through, then add 1 cup of red chile sauce and 1 cup of vegan cheese.",
      "Spinach - Warm 4 cloves of minced garlic in 2 tablespoons of cooking oil for about 5 minutes. Pour in 10 oz of baby spinach and sprinkle with a little salt, then cover with a lid. Stir every few minutes until wilted.",
      "Corn and Bean - Saute 1/2 an onion in 2 tablespoons of oil until translucent. Add a can of black beans that have been drained and rinsed along with 1 cup of frozen corn and 2 teaspoons of cumin. (This is also good with 1/2 cup of green chile added.)",
      "Green Chile Cheese - Mix 1 cup of New Mexican green chile sauce with 1 cup of vegan cheese.",
      "Assemble the tamales",
      "To assemble the tamales, place a soaked cornhusk flat on the countertop with the pointy side toward you. Take about 1/4 cup of the dough and spread it onto the top half of the cornhusk about 1/2 inch from the top making a square about 5 inches wide and a little less than 1/2 inch thick. (You can wet your fingers so that the dough won't stick and easily shape the dough with your hands.)",
      "Place about 2 tablespoons of filling down the center of the dough.",
      "Pick up both sides of the cornhusk and have the edges meet in the center over the top of the filling. Then tuck one side of the corn husk into the other and wrap it into a burrito shape.",
      "Pick up the bottom of the corn husk and fold it up tight to the bottom of the tamale. Use a long skinny piece of cornhusk (or culinary string) to tie around the tamale and keep it from opening up during the steaming process.",
      "Repeat this process until you have a steamer basket full of tamales.",
      "Cover with a lid and steam the tamales for 35 minutes. Allow them to cool for about 10 minutes before eating. (They will be a little soft when they come out of the steamer, but firm up significantly as they cool.)",
      "Serve topped with red chile sauce, green chile sauce, or salsa. Tamales are much better when served with a sauce. Red or green chile sauce is traditional and a mix of both is called \"Christmas!\"",
      "* Don't make these alone. It's a lot of assembly. Have some friends or family help and set up an assembly line.",
      "* Keep a bowl of water on the countertop next to you to dip your fingers in. The masa dough won't stick to wet fingers."

    "notes": "Original recipe from Brian Patton of The Sexy Vegan. If you do not want to deep fry, you can pan fry the nuggets as well. Just note that you may need to add more oil overtime. You can bake these chicken nuggets as well! Lay them on an oiled baking sheet after breading and bake at 400F for 15-20 minutes, or until nice and crispy. You can make these ahead of time and freeze them in an airtight freezer-safe container until serving. After cooking the nuggets, cool them completely. Warm them through in an oven at 400F for 10-15 minutes, or until crispy. To make the breading as seamless as possible, we like to wipe our hands with a wet towel/rinse our hands clean between each nugget. This prevents batter build up on our fingers and will help you get a more even coat on the nuggets! Try to fry your nuggets soon after breading to prevent them from getting gummy."

If desired, you can refrigerate the dough overnight or even for a few days. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 325 F. Fold the bag in half, then roll the dough out from inside the bag until it takes up the one half of the bag (as shown in the third photo in this post). Cut open the bag, cut out shapes, and place on a baking tray. Bake 11 minutes. They\u2019ll look a little underdone, so let them cool and do not touch them for at least 10 minutes. Be sure the cookies are completely cooled before frosting them, or the frosting will melt."

Sweet Potato Toast By: The Jaroudi Family Makes 4 Ingredients: For the Sweet Potato Toast: 2 large sweet potatoes (each cut into 2 long \u00bc-inch thick slices) For the Homemade Raspberry Jam: 2 cups fresh or frozen raspberries 3-4 Medjool dates, pitted (or 3 Tbsp date paste) 1/4 cup water 2 Tbsp chia seeds \u00bd tsp vanilla powder For Toppings: 2 large bananas, sliced 4 Tbsp nut or seed butter of choice (optional) Directions: 1\\. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the sweet potato slices on the baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway, until tender but firm enough to hold toppings. (Alternatively, toast each slice in a toaster on high for 2-3 rounds until cooked through and slightly crispy.) In a small saucepan over medium heat, add the raspberries, dates, and water. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally and mashing the raspberries with a fork. Once soft and combined, remove from heat and stir in the chia seeds and vanilla powder. Let sit for 5 minutes to thicken. If needed, blend for a smoother texture. Spread raspberry jam evenly over each sweet potato slice. Top with sliced banana and drizzle with nut or seed butter (if using). Zucchini Fries & Ranch Dressing By: The Jaroudi Family Ingredients: 2 large zucchinis, sliced into long fry shape 1\u20442 cup unsweetened plant-based milk 1 Tbsp ground flaxseed + 3 tablespoons water (flax egg) 3\u20444 cup breadcrumbs (or homemade oat crumbs) 1\u20444 cup nutritional yeast 1 tsp garlic powder 1 tsp onion powder 1 tsp smoked paprika 1 tsp Italian seasoning 1\u20444 tsp ground black pepper Whole Food Plant-Based Ranch: 1 cup raw cashews (or cooked white beans) 1/2 cup water 2 Tbsp lemon juice 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 tsp white miso paste 2 tsp dried dill 1 tsp onion powder 1 tsp dried parsley Directions: 1.) Set your oven to 400\u00b0F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. 2.) In a small bowl, mix the ground flaxseed with water and let it sit for 5 minutes until it thickens. 3.) In one bowl, pour the plant-based milk. In a separate bowl, combine the breadcrumbs (or oat crumbs), nutritional yeast, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, Italian seasoning, and black pepper. Stir to mix. 4.) Dip each zucchini fry into the plant milk. Then, coat it in the flax egg mixture. Finally, press it into the breadcrumb mixture, ensuring an even coating. 5.) Arrange the coated zucchini in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown and crispy. Whole Food Plant-Based Ranch**: In a high-speed blender, combine all the ingredients until smooth. Refrigerate the ranch until ready to serve.

Add onion and saut\u00e9 with a splash of water or broth until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and ginger, cooking for another 1-2 minutes. Pour in the pureed tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add coriander powder, garam masala, turmeric, smoked paprika, and cinnamon. Stir well. Stir in the chickpeas, plant-based milk, and water/vegetable broth. Simmer for 10 minutes until thickened. Mix in the white miso paste.

In a large bowl, add the vital wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, garbanzo bean flour, garlic powder, onion powder, poultry seasoning, salt, and black pepper.

In the second bowl, mix together the all-purpose flour, panko breadcrumbs, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Whisk together until uniform and set both aside.",

      "* Original recipe from Brian Patton of The Sexy Vegan.",
      "* If you do not want to deep fry, you can pan fry the nuggets as well. Just note that you may need to add more oil overtime.",
      "* You can bake these chicken nuggets as well! Lay them on an oiled baking sheet after breading and bake at 400F for 15-20 minutes, or until nice and crispy.",
      "* You can make these ahead of time and freeze them in an airtight freezer-safe container until serving. After cooking the nuggets, cool them completely. Warm them through in an oven at 400F for 10-15 minutes, or until crispy.",
      "* To make the breading as seamless as possible, we like to wipe our hands with a wet towel/rinse our hands clean between each nugget. This prevents batter build up on our fingers and will help you get a more even coat on the nuggets!",
      "* Try to fry your nuggets soon after breading to prevent them from getting gummy."
